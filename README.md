I’m still spinning, like when you're in the middle of a juggling routine and forget which hand's the start, can't quite land your own thoughts. Theater's still vibrating behind me, leftover sound bzzzz-ing in my ears like a crazy symphony. Ugh, popcorn kernels stuck in the back of my coat, and the smell of old cola. Why always like this??? That movie, a pinwheel in my head - wait wait, oh yeah ‘Where There Is Love, There Is No Darkness’ or whatever. Jeez, what a ride. 

There was this scene... or was it three scenes blending? You know when you wake up mid-tumbling and swore you were flying — heads above clouds. I think someone was talking about bird migrations, and suddenly this blinding light, warmth like sun streaming through circus tent flaps just right. My back still sore from that damn theater seat. Hitchcock? No, too soft, more like sipping hot cocoa on a melting rollercoaster. The kind with odd caramel strings.

> Download the movie if you can, totally forgot you asked, it really does feels like a blanket of stars pulled over your eyes. Sticks with you, like glitter dusted over fresh paint. One moment it’s thick with color, then a whoosh, and it’s... gone? That bicycle ride — with red balloons, deft and achingly silent — mirrors the way I felt balancing on the tightrope for the first time without a safety net. Adrenaline or illusion? Kinda one of those, you know?

Oh, right, that dialogue, it was like juggling memories with exaggerated gestures — roaring laughter at one point, echoes dancing off domed ceiling like a laugh track from outer space. Was it existential? Or like a warm hug? Sometimes I swear it’s all the same. Everyone should just watch the movie, or else it’d be like trying to explain juggling to a fish.

And the oh-my-god background music! It was everywhere and nowhere, like being inside a massive organ out of tune yet perfectly tuned for the storm scene, lights flashing like tequila shots at a clown party. Not sure any of this does justice but my thumb won’t stop typing.
